# Production Configuration Examples

This directory contains production-ready configuration examples for Simple NFS Daemon, designed for enterprise deployment.

## Files

- `simple-nfsd.conf` - Production INI configuration

## Features

- **Full NFS Protocol Support**: NFSv3 and NFSv4
- **Enhanced Security**: AUTH_SYS and AUTH_DH authentication
- **Performance Optimized**: Larger buffers and connection limits
- **Network Access Control**: Allowed/denied network lists
- **Monitoring Integration**: Health checks and metrics
- **Backup Configuration**: Automated backup settings

## Key Differences from Simple Configuration

### Performance
- Increased `max_connections` to 1000
- Larger buffer sizes (64KB)
- Multi-threading support
- Higher file size limits

### Security
- Network access control lists
- Enhanced authentication options
- Production logging levels
- Access restrictions

### Monitoring
- Health check intervals
- Metrics collection
- Performance monitoring
- Backup scheduling

## Usage

1. **Review Configuration**: Examine all settings before deployment
2. **Customize Network Settings**: Update allowed/denied networks
3. **Configure Exports**: Set up your specific export paths
4. **Set Security Parameters**: Adjust authentication and access control
5. **Deploy**: Copy to production system and start service

## Security Considerations

- Review `allowed_networks` and `denied_networks` carefully
- Ensure proper file permissions on configuration files
- Consider using encrypted authentication methods
- Regular security audits recommended
- Monitor access logs for suspicious activity

## Performance Tuning

- Adjust `max_connections` based on expected load
- Tune buffer sizes for your network conditions
- Monitor resource usage and adjust accordingly
- Consider load balancing for high availability

## Backup Strategy

- Configure backup schedule according to your needs
- Ensure backup storage has sufficient capacity
- Test backup and restore procedures
- Monitor backup job success/failure
